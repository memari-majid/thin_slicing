In this study, researchers aimed to investigate the relative importance of verbal, paraverbal, and nonverbal behavior in first impression formation, specifically in relation to perceptions of warmth, competence, and morality. They analyzed 90-second videos of speakers introducing themselves and used both human raters and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to rate the behaviors displayed. The results showed that while nonverbal behaviors were most strongly associated with warmth impressions, verbal and paraverbal behaviors were more strongly associated with competence and morality impressions. The study also found that morality impressions were the least predictable from thin slices of behavior, and the behaviors most important for understanding impression formation differed for warmth and morality. The study's limitations include its observational nature, which precludes establishing causal relationships, and its focus on a specific population and context, which may limit its external validity. Nonetheless, the study's use of dynamic behaviors and AI-facilitated analyses offers a novel and promising approach for future research on the dynamics of social cognition.
